There should be more of a readme here, but for now:

This is a simple plugin for JBrowse that provides the Alliance logo in the JBrowse page.  Simply place this directory in the jbrowse/plugins directory and add 
```
[ plugins.AlliancePlugin ]
location = plugins/AlliancePlugin
```
to the jbrowse.conf file
